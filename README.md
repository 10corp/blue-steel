# Blue Steel

**Is there more to a blog than being really really really ridiculously good looking?**

Of course not. Introducing Blue Steel.

### Responsive Wordpress theme using Roots - Inspired by The Verge
Blue steel is a minimalist wordpress theme made by [Class Central](https://www.class-central.com/) and built on top of [Roots](http://roots.io/). The blog post pages are inspired by [The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/)

## Instructions
To use Blue Steel, you need to know and understand how to use [Roots](http://roots.io/) and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). It requires modifications before you can use it. The theme contains elements specific to [Class Central](https://www.class-central.com/) i.e footer and navbar. So you will need to fork it and modify to match your needs. If you need someone to help with that, you can reach out to [Codelight](http://codelight.eu/).

`wp-config.php` refers to `local-wp-config.php` and expects it be a level up from the current folder. Update the database parameters and other settings in this file. Make sure to use accurate values for WP_HOME, WP_SITEURL, WP_CONTENT_DIR, WP_CONTENT_URL; this will save you a lot of headache.
